# Healthy Recipe Book

## Introduction

The application will be a handy tool for **someone who want to eat 
healthy meals but devote little time in meal planning process**. Anyone 
who want to lose weight, gain muscles, or just maintain healthy can use
this application. I am interested in developing this application because I usually spend too much
time on cooking but I want devote the time to study.

In the application, users can add recipes and nutritional 
value (total calories, carbohydrate, protein, and fat) of them, 
 and keep track of the nutritional value in each meal.

## Phase 4: Task 3
- I would like to work on the Gui class. There are many duplications of code, like setActionCommand, add buttons, and 
actionListeners for many times in the initializeButton method. I can find a way to cooperate the action of initialize a 
single button, and call it on different buttons to avoid code duplications.
